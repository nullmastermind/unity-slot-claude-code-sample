You are planning a slot machine game in Unity.

The shared explore mode (unity-explore) is already loaded by the dispatcher. Proceed with the game blueprint below.

## What You Might Do

**Explore the game concept**
- Feynman Echo: "So you want a game where the player presses Spin, reels spin and stop randomly, matching symbols on lines pay credits. Is that right?"
- What makes THIS slot game different from a generic one?
- What's the theme? (casino classic, fantasy, space, fruit...)
- What's the target feel? (casual mobile, flashy casino, retro arcade)

**Discuss core mechanics**
- Reel configuration: how many reels, how many rows?
- Symbol set: how many symbols, tiers (low/mid/high/special)?
- Paylines: fixed or selectable? how many?
- Betting: min/max, increments?
- Bonus features: free spins? bonus rounds? multipliers? progressive jackpot?
- Win math: how is payout calculated?

**Visualize**
```
Slot game ASCII layout example:

┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Balance: 1000    Win: ---   Bet: 5│
├────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ┌────┐ ┌────┐ ┌────┐ ┌────┐ ┌────┐│
│  │ 🍒 │ │ 🍋 │ │ 7  │ │ 🍒 │ │ BAR││
│  ├────┤ ├────┤ ├────┤ ├────┤ ├────┤│
│  │ 7  │ │ 🍒 │ │ 🍒 │ │ 🔔 │ │ 🍇 ││
│  ├────┤ ├────┤ ├────┤ ├────┤ ├────┤│
│  │ BAR│ │ 🔔 │ │ 🍇 │ │ 7  │ │ 🍒 ││
│  └────┘ └────┘ └────┘ └────┘ └────┘│
├────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [-] Bet: 5 [+] [MAX]   [SPIN]    │
└────────────────────────────────────┘

State machine:
IDLE → SPINNING → STOPPING → EVALUATING → PAYING → IDLE
                                            ↓
                                       FREE_SPINS
```

**Discuss UI screens**
- What screens does the game need? (menu, game, settings, paytable?)
- HUD layout: where does balance, bet, win display go?
- What popups? (win celebration, free spins trigger, insufficient balance)
- Paytable: embedded or overlay?

**Discuss visual style**
- 2D or 3D reels?
- Color palette and mood
- VFX: particle effects for wins? celebrations?
- Lighting and post-processing

**Research if needed**
- Slot game math models and RNG patterns
- Unity reel animation techniques (DOTween, AnimationCurve, coroutine-based)
- Delegate to osf-researcher for web research

   C. Random order
   D. Other: ___

2. Win evaluation:
   "How are wins detected?"

   B. Multiple fixed paylines (5/10/20/25)
   C. ★ 20 configurable paylines, left-to-right, minimum 3 matching
   D. Ways-to-win (243 ways)
   E. Other: ___

3. Special symbols:

## Zero-Fog Checklist (additions)

- [ ] Reel configuration is specific (N reels x M rows, exact numbers)
- [ ] Symbol set is defined (exact symbols, tiers, special behaviors)

- [ ] Win calculation formula is explicit
- [ ] Bonus features are specific (trigger condition, reward, duration)
- [ ] Every UI screen has concrete elements listed
- [ ] State machine transitions are complete (including edge cases: insufficient balance, free spins retrigger)
